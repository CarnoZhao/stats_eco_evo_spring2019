# Course Description

The goal of this course is to introduce data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling with an emphasis on applications in ecology and evolution. In the first few weeks of class, we'll become familiar with using the R programming language for data handling and visualization. For the remainder of the semester, we'll explore the statistical workhorse of ecology and evolution: linear regression. The primary aim is to develop a firm grasp of how this method works "under the hood" so we have a strong conceptual basis for understanding other, more complex statistical methods as extensions of the basic linear regression strategy. For example, when we encounter new data types, instead of adopting entirely new statistical procedures or performing transformations to make our data better fit our statistical approach, we will simply use the same regression modeling framework with new likelihood distributions that are consistent with our outcome data (i.e., generalized linear modeling). Late in the course, we will begin to implement models with multiple layers that fit different levels of the data, thereby leading to improved parameter estimates and predictions (i.e., generalized linear mixed modeling). Along the way, there will be a primer in Bayesian statistical philosophy, and we'll touch on related considerations like model selection.

At the conclusion of this course, you should be much more comfortable working with data in R. You will be able to read the ecology and evolution literature with a critical eye towards statistical procedures and interpretation. You should be well-positioned to use your knowledge regarding the fundamentals of regression modeling to learn more specialized, complicated types of statistical models.


# Course Texts

The primary text for this course is [*Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan*](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Richard McElreath. This is an incredibly accessible statistics book, and it will serve us well in establishing the foundations of regression modeling. It is worth checking online retailers for the book since used copies can sometimes be found at a discount. The book contains extensive R code, so it will also assist us in strengthening our R skills throughout the semester. **I highly encourage you to work step-by-step through the book material in R as you complete your readings.** In coding, as in most things, practice makes perfect. 

In addition to chapters from *Statistical Rethinking*, there will be some additional assigned readings from the scientific literature and blogs. I will post all of these materials on the class CourseWorks site or else they are freely available online and linked in the syllabus.


# Course Organization

The course topic for each week will be introduced through that week's readings. Therefore, it is imperative that you do the required reading for this class *before* the relevant lecture. **If you do not complete the readings, you will be lost!** Lectures will closely follow readings and should help solidify your understanding of the material. In lab sections, you will address problems in statistical coding in an environment where help is readily available from myself and the course TAs. Finally, homework assignments are your opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the material through independent work. Homework assignments will be released on Wednesday of each week and will be due the following Tuesday at 5 pm.

Those enrolled in the graduate course will also complete an additional research project assignment throughout the semester. Project details will be provided separately.


# Computers and Software

This course will be taught entirely in the R programming language. R is widely used by researchers in ecology and evolution, has a diverse ecosystem of packages that provide specialized functionality, and is free. R can be downloaded for all major operating systems [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/) (choose the "precompiled binary distribution" option). In addition, we'll be using the RStudio software to work more easily with R. Essentially, RStudio spruces up the basic R software with a number of convenient features, and many users never interact with R except through RStudio. The version of RStudio intended for personal use (RStudio Desktop) is also free. Install the software [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (scroll down to "Installers for Supported Platforms" and select your operating system). 

While not required, having a personal computer for this class will be a significant benefit given that R coding will be a major focus of teaching and all homework assignments will require access to a computer. If you have one, I encourage you to bring your personal computers to lecture and follow along with the class material on your own machine. If you exercise this option, do not be a distraction to other students by using your computer for anything not course-related during class time. **Please attempt to install R and Rstudio on your personal computers prior to the start of the course, but if you have trouble, we will be able to help you with software installation during the first week of class.** Computers will be available in the lab space during lab sections for all students, and these machines can also be used to complete homework assignments as needed.


# Course GitHub

In addition to using the typical CourseWorks site, I will also maintain a [GitHub repository for this course](https://github.com/eveskew/stats_eco_evo_spring2019). This will allow others to freely access materials and also provides an opportunity for you to become familiar with git and GitHub, if you're so inclined.

# Grading

## Grading Breakdown

```{r grading breakdown, echo = FALSE}

table <- data.frame(
  rbind(
    c("Homework", "70%", "55%"),
    c("Lab Attendance and Participation", "10%", "10%"),
    c("Final Exam", "20%", "20%"),
    c("Research Project", "N/A", "15%")
  )
)

colnames(table) <- c("**Assignment**", "**UN3005**", "**GR5005**")

kable(table, align = "c")
```

## Grading Scale

```{r grading scale, echo = FALSE}

table <- data.frame(
  rbind(
    c("97.50 - 100", "A+"),
    c("92.50 - 97.49", "A"),
    c("90.00 - 92.49", "A-"),
    c("87.50 - 89.99", "B+"),
    c("82.50 - 87.49", "B"),
    c("80.00 - 82.49", "B-"),
    c("77.50 - 79.99", "C+"),
    c("72.50 - 77.49", "C"),
    c("70.00 - 72.49", "C-"),
    c("60.00 - 69.99", "D"),
    c("< 60.00", "F")
  )
)

colnames(table) <- c("**Percentage**", "**Grade**")

kable(table, align = "c")
```

## Grading Policies

In this course, **late assignments will receive no credit.** However, before final grades are calculated, **I will drop your lowest homework grade.** This is intended to provide all students with protection against any circumstances that might affect the timeliness or quality of your work. Your lab grade will be determined by your weekly attendance and engagement with the material. Similar to my homework grading policy, **I will grant all students one lab absence for the semester without penalty.**

If a serious medical, family, or other emergency may prevent you from completing an assignment on time, please talk with me as soon as possible about the circumstances, and we will discuss plans for helping you to complete your work. I will grant assignment extensions only in cases of extreme emergency, which are determined at my discretion.

For homework assignments, I encourage you to discuss the problem sets and potential solutions with your classmates. **However, if it becomes obvious that any students are directly copying each other's work, all students involved will be penalized.** In other words, feel free to work with your classmates to figure out *how* you should address a given problem, but the coding and any written interpretation should be your own work. This course's final exam will be a take-home exam that must be completed independently.

# Supplementary Resources

There are an overwhelming number of resources on R coding and statistics, both in print and online. Any attempt to summarize this material is woefully incomplete, but I've tried to point out a few items that might be of particular interest. The R programming and data visualization resources may be of use during this class if you want additional treatment of the material we're covering (as a plus, a couple of them are free online). In contrast, the statistical modeling books would be good to pick up at the conclusion of this course if you're looking to dive into more advanced statistical models.
